Daemo succeeds when workers and requesters collaborate to ensure fair pay and high quality work.
The requester for "{{ project_name }}" has indicated that you may have misunderstood their project.
They are asking you to revise your responses before accepting the work.
<a href="{{ task_url }}">You can make changes and resubmit here.</a>
<br/>
<br/>
The requester's reasoning for asking for the revision:
"{{ return_reason }}"
<br/>
<br/>
In cases where the requester is abusing their privileges by returning high-quality work, we will review the case and make a determination.
If you wish to contest the return, send an email to support@daemo.org including the project name, the requester,
and a summary of the interaction, including the revisions that were requested.
